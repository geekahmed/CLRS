# Chapter 1. The Role of Algorithms in Computing

 1. Algorithm can be defined informally as an well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output.
 2. The statement of a computaional problem specifies in general terms the desired I/O relationship.
 3. An instance of a problem consists of the input needed to compute a solution to the problem.
 4. A correct algorithm should halt with correct values of every input instance.
 5. Incorrect algorithm is also useful if we could control the error rate.
 6. An algorithm can be specified in English, as a computer program, or even as a hardware design.
 7. The only requirement is that the specification must provide a precise description of the computational procedure to be followed.
