# Chapter 1. The Role of Algorithms in Computing
## Algorithms
- An algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes aome value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output.
- Computational problem specifies in general terms the desired input/output relationship.
- An instance of a problem consists of the input needed to compute a solution to the problem.
- An algorithm is said to be correct if, for every input instance, it halts with the correct output.
- Some problems that need algorithmic thinking:
	- The Human Genome Project.
	- Internet Routing.
	- Cryptography.
	- Resources Allocation.
- A data structure is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications.
## Algorithms as a technology
- Different algorithms devised to solve the same problem often differ dramatically in their efficiency.
- As an example, merge sort excels insertion sort on a very large input.
- Total system performance depends on choosing efficient algorithms as much as on choosing fast hardware.
